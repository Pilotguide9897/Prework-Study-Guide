        <ul>
          <li>The command line allows us to input text commands to execute operating system functions (e.g., creating a new folder or opening a file).</li>
          <li>The terminal is the application that allows us to interact with the shell, the software that interprets and executes the various commands that get typed into the terminal.</li>
          <li>cd: allows us to change directories.</li>
          <li>ls: allows us to see a list of files and directories on our computer.</li>
          <li>pwd: short for 'print working directory,' this command prints out the directory that we are currently in inside the terminal.</li>
          <li>cd ..: allows you to navigate backward one directory at a time.</li>
          <li>mkdir: allows you to "MaKe a directory. To create a named directory, simply type mkdir __________ (name of directory to be created).</li>
          <li> touch: this command allows the creation of a new file. You write touch __________.hypothetical file type.</li>

        <h2>SSH Keys</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An SSH key is an access credential for the secure shell (SSH) network protocol.</li>
            <li>Generating SSH keys allows developers to interface with certain remote services without having to constantly retype login information.</li>
            <li>To The following is a summary of the steps to check for existing SSH keys: Enter ls -al ~/.ssh in your terminal (Git Bash for Windows or Terminal for macOS) to see if any existing SSH keys are present. Look for a public SSH key that ends in .pub. For example, id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, or id_ed25519.pub. If you see an existing SSH key pair (a public SSH key like id_rsa.pub and a private SSH key like id_rsa), then you can skip generating a new SSH key and use your existing keys to add to the ssh-agent in a later step. If you receive an error that it does not exist, that means you will need to generate a new SSH key pair.</li>
            <li>To generate an SSH key: Enter ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “your_email@example.com” in your terminal to create a new SSH key. When prompted, save your key in the default file location and create a secure passphrase.</li>
            <li>Once you have your SSH key, you can add them to the ssh-agent by: </li>
            <li>Enter eval “$(ssh-agent -s)” in your terminal to start the ssh-agent. For macOS, you might need to run a few additional commands to start the ssh-agent and add your SSH key. That can include running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent. Follow the GitHub Docs carefully to do this step successfully. Add your private SSH key to the ssh-agent using the ssh-add command.</li>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. You can think of HTML as the frame of a website. It is made up of elements that work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage. Common types of elements in HTML are: (1) Text elements, (2) Image elements, (3) Header elements, and (4) List elements. These elements add visible information on the page. </li>
          <li>In addition to visible elements, there are also elements that are used to divide the content on a page and describe the content to browsers and other developers. Examples of these are: (1) Meta-related elements, (2) Content division elements, and (3) Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>In HTML, elements are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angled brackets [< >]. These tags contain everything that we want to include about the element and include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. Two especially important elements, however, are the head and body elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage that helps the browser render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to be able to see and interact with must be placed inside the element.</li>
          <li>You use the h(1-6) tag to add a header of certain levels.</li>
          <li>You can use the ul tag to add a list. Each element in the list needs to be indicated by the li element.</li>
          <li>You need to use multiple li elements to add more items. Each one represents a new bullet point in your list.</li>
          <li>The class attribute is used to point to a class name in a style sheet and can also be used by JS to access and manupulate elements with the specific class name.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is useful for adding visual elements to websites.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding is not quite the same as a margin, although people often confuse them. A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>
          <li>We can assign colours in css using semantic reference such as, grey, or using a hexidecimal code (hex #) to refer to a colour.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border.</li>
          <li>A period (.) in front of a selector designates that as a class selector, meaning that any HTML element assigned to the class will gain the specified propery assignments from that block of CSS.</li>
          <li>There are multiple ways to incorporate CSS into your HTML document: (1) Inline - by using the style attribute inside an HTML element, (2) Internal - by using a style element in the head section, and (3) External - by using a link element to link to an external css file. The link element goes in the head element of the website because that is where the metadata of the webpage is stored.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: Used to pull the base branch. It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before you push any code up.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is used to add functionality and interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allow us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task, and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean that it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
          <li>We use an open curly bracket after a function to show that it is not adding an arugment.</li>
          <li>If statements allow us to perform logical comparisons between a value and what you expect. Then it allows you to use that information to perform an action.</li>
          <li>For loops can be very useful for controlling the work flow. For loops function by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain condition has been satisfied. For loops contain two sections: A header and a body.</li>
          <li>JavaScript contains five basic (primitive) data types. These types are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.</li>
          <li>Strings are collections of alphaneumeric characters and symbols. Strings are useful for storing letters and words.</li>
          <li>Booleans may only have two values, true and false, and represent all data which has only two states.</li>
          <li>Undefined means that a variable has been created, but that it has not been assigned a value.</li>
          <li>Two other common data types in JavaScript are objects and arrays. Both of these data types consist of collections, and are a way to group together multiple points of data into a single piece.</li>
          <li>Arrays are a special variable that holds more than one value. Arrays alloy you to hold more than one piece of data under a single title and you can access specific numbers in the annex by referring to an index number. It is common practice to declare an array by using the const keyword.</li>
          <li>When creating an array in JS, spaces and line breaks are unimportant. A declaration may span multiple lines.</li>
          <li>Objects in JS can be very diverse and may refer to documents, other webpages, etc.</li>
