# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- The motivating factor behind the creation of this study-guide website was to have a one-stop shop for keeping and collecting notes and other observations to assist me as I begin my coding journey. In this sense, I developed this project because the information that it will contain shall be a useful reference for me as I continue to learn more. Further, I embarked on this creative journey because having the opportunity to practice implementing all the skills and knowledge that I have been exposed to thus far throughout the bootcamp is the perfect opportunity to help solidify each concept in my mind. 
- Creating this project has helped to make the process of developing a simple webpage much more tangible and simple to recall by demystifying the various steps. I have enjoyed making this project because it has provided a chance to experiment a little bit in a safe, controlled, low-stress environment where no matter what I do, I cannot mess anything up too much. Overall, I am pleased with how the project has turned out. 
- The problems that this project was created to solve were threefold. Firstly, it helps to solve the problem of how to arrange and organize information that I learn throughout the bootcamp. Rather than needing to try to keep physical notes, I can keep them all in one secure place. Secondly, it helps to solve the problem of not having any previous coding experience to my name by giving me an opportunity to get in a little bit of basic coding work. Thirdly, it helps to solve the problem of my having difficulty applying a developer mindset, as it has challenged me to start applying web-development principles and considering best practices so that my website may turn out as well and be as easy to use and navigate as possible. All in all, I feel that it accomplishes each of these goals well.
- In line with the problem-solving aspect of this project and the function that the site serves, it has also provided an excellent opportunity for me to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. Further, the process of running into challenges and roadblocks has helped me begin learning to think like a web-developer and troubleshoot why my code may not be executing like I had expected. In fact, bug fixing has been a surprisingly fun and rewarding experience. Perhaps the largest challenge that I ran into during this project was right at the start as I was getting all my technology set up to allow me to begin. At first I found the idea of needing to learn about SSH keys, Git and GitHub, VS Code, and the terminal before even beginning to be a daunting task. Fortunately, none of this was overwhelming when I took my time and really tried to understand how it all fits together, and now feel like I have a much better understanding and appreciation of all the moving parts that go into web design and this just makes me more excited to truly begin my educational journey!
- I hope that this application's combination of information makes it unique among others of its kind which are similarly created to help people study the basics of web-design. This page may also stand out among others because it contains a section detailing information on SSH keys, as this was a topic that I was unfamiliar with prior to beginning this project.
- As I continue to learn more and expand my knowledge, I hope to be able to continue to update this page with new and valuable information. There are no plans at this time to update the visual elements of the site, although this may be subject to change depending on how much this page comes to eventually contain and whether I encounter new ideas that I want to try implementing.
