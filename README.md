# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- The motivation behind the creation of this study-guide website was to have a one-stop shop for keeping and collecting notes and other observations to assist me as I begin my coding journey. In this sense, I developed this project because the information that it will contain shall be a useful reference for me as I continue to learn more. Further, I embarked on this creative journey because having the opportunity to practice implementing all the skills and knowledge that I have been exposed to thus far throughout the bootcamp is the perfect opportunity to help solidify each concept in my mind. 
- Creating this project has helped to make the process of developing a simple webpage much more tangible and simple to recall by demystifying the many staps. I have enjoyed making this project because it has provided an opportunity to experiment a little bit in a safe, controlled, low-stress environment where no matter what I do, I cannot mess anything up too much. Overall, I am pleased with how the project has turned out. 
- The problem that this project was created to solve were threefold. Firstly, it helps to solve the problem of how to arrange and organize information that I learn throughout the bootcamp. Rather than needing to try to keep physical notes, I can keep my notes all in one place. Secondly, it helps to solve the problem of not having any previous coding experience to my name by giving me an opportunity to get in a little bit of basic coding work.
Thirdly, it helps to solve the problem of my having difficulty applying a developer mindset, as it has challenged me to begin applying web-development principles and considering best practices so that my website may turn out well and be as easy to use and navigate as possible. All in all, I feel that it accomplishes each of these goals well.
- In line with the problem-solving aspect of this project and the function that the site serves, it has also provided an excellent opportunity for me to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. Further, the process of running into challenges and roadblocks has helped me to begin learning how to think like a web-developer and troubleshoot why my code may not be executing like I had expected. In fact, bug fixing has been a surprisingly fun and rewarding experience.
